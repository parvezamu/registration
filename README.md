Enhanced Deep Learning Model for Multi-Modal Brain Image Registration

This repository contains an advanced brain image registration framework based on deep learning, attention mechanisms, and deformation constraints. It is specifically designed for multi-modal neuroimaging registration, particularly in stroke analysis using the MICCAI ISLES 2018 dataset.

Project Overview

Brain image registration is a critical step in medical image analysis, aligning different imaging modalities to a common anatomical space. This repository provides:

- A U-Net-based registration model with channel attention and multi-branch deformation estimation.
- Integration with the IIT Human Brain Atlas for anatomical correspondence matching.
- Optimized patch-based registration with 5-fold cross-validation.
- Evaluation using MSE, SSIM, Dice Coefficient, and Jacobian Determinants.

Features

- Multi-Modal Registration: CT, CBF, CBV, Tmax, and MTT images.
- Deep Learning-Based: U-Net with multi-branch deformation model.
- Channel Attention Mechanism: Enhances feature relevance.
- Patch-Based Processing: Efficient registration with anatomical precision.
- Cross-Validation Support: Robust generalization.
- Adaptable Framework: Easily extendable to other neuroimaging datasets.

Dataset

The model is tested on the [MICCAI ISLES 2018 dataset](https://www.isles-challenge.org/):
- 103 stroke cases (63 training, 40 testing)
- Modalities: CT, CBF, CBV, MTT, Tmax
- Pre-aligned to MNI space
- DWI-based manual lesion segmentation as ground truth

Atlas used:

Model Architecture

1. Encoder  
- 4-level feature extractor with residual + dropout
- Instance normalization and ReLU activation

2. Channel Attention  
- Dual-branch attention with sigmoid gating
- Emphasizes informative features

3. Multi-Branch Deformation Estimation  
- Five parallel branches: Main, CBF, CBV, Tmax, MTT  
- Weighted combination to yield smooth deformation field

Loss Functions

- MSE ‚Äì voxel-wise intensity similarity  
- SSIM ‚Äì structural similarity  
- Dice Coefficient ‚Äì segmentation overlap (optional)  
- Jacobian Determinant Regularization ‚Äì topology preservation  
- Smoothness Loss ‚Äì penalizes abrupt deformation changes
